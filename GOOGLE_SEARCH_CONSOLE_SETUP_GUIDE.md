## 📋 PART 1: Google Search Console Setup (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Google Search Console Account (5 minutes)

1. **Visit Google Search Console:**
   - URL: https://search.google.com/search-console
   - Sign in with your Google account

2. **Add Property:**
   - Click "Add Property" or "+" button
   - Choose: **"Domain"** property type (recommended)
   - Enter domain: `disasterrecovery.com.au`
   - Click "Continue"

**Why Domain Property?**
- Covers all subdomains (www, blog, app, etc.)
- Covers all protocols (http, https)
- Comprehensive coverage for future growth

### Step 2: Verify Domain Ownership (10 minutes)

Google will provide a **DNS TXT record** that you need to add to your domain's DNS settings.

#### Option A: DNS TXT Record Verification (Recommended)

**DNS Record Details:**
```
Type: TXT
Name: @ (or leave blank for root domain)
Value: google-site-verification=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
TTL: 3600 (1 hour)
```

**Where to Add DNS Record:**

**If using Vercel for domain management:**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to: Project → Settings → Domains
3. Click on `disasterrecovery.com.au`
4. Add DNS Record:
   - Type: `TXT`
   - Name: `@`
   - Value: `google-site-verification=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`
5. Save and wait 5-10 minutes for propagation

**If using external domain registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.):**
1. Log into your domain registrar account
2. Navigate to: DNS Management or Advanced DNS
3. Add new TXT record with values above
4. Save and wait 5-10 minutes for propagation

**Verification:**
1. Return to Google Search Console
2. Click "Verify" button
3. If successful: "Ownership verified" message appears
4. If failed: Wait 10 more minutes and try again (DNS propagation delay)

#### Option B: HTML Meta Tag Verification (Alternative)

If you can't access DNS settings, use HTML meta tag verification:

**Meta Tag Provided by Google:**
```html
<meta name="google-site-verification" content="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" />
```

**Where to Add:**
- File: `apps/web/app/layout.tsx`
- Location: Inside `<head>` section
- Line: After other meta tags (around line 50-60)

**Example:**
```typescript
export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
      <head>
        {/* Existing meta tags */}
        <meta name="google-site-verification" content="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" />
      </head>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

**Deploy to production:**
```bash
git add apps/web/app/layout.tsx
git commit -m "feat: Add Google Search Console verification meta tag"
git push origin main
```

Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel deployment, then verify in Search Console.

### Step 3: Submit Sitemaps (5 minutes)

Once domain is verified:

1. **Navigate to Sitemaps Section:**
   - In Google Search Console sidebar
   - Click "Sitemaps"

2. **Submit Main Sitemap:**
   - Enter sitemap URL: `sitemap.xml`
   - Click "Submit"
   - Status should show: "Success" or "Pending" (will be crawled within 24 hours)

3. **Submit Contractor Sitemap:**
   - Enter sitemap URL: `sitemap-contractors.xml`
   - Click "Submit"
   - Status should show: "Success" or "Pending"

**Expected Results (Within 48 Hours):**
- Discovered URLs: 6,000-11,000 pages
- Submitted: 2 sitemaps
- Indexed: Will grow over 1-2 weeks (start with ~100 URLs, then 1,000+, eventually 6,000+)

### Step 4: Configure Search Console Settings (Optional - 5 minutes)

**Email Notifications:**
- Navigate to: Settings → Users and Permissions
- Add team email: `support@disasterrecovery.com.au`
- Enable notifications for:
  - Critical issues (manual actions, security issues)
  - Indexing errors
  - Mobile usability issues

**Target Geographic Location:**
- Navigate to: Settings → Crawling
- Set target country: **Australia**
- This helps Google understand your target audience

## 🚨 Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Domain Verification Failed

**Symptoms:** "Verification failed" error in Google Search Console

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 10-15 minutes for DNS propagation
2. Check TXT record is correct (no extra spaces, correct value)
3. Use `dig` or `nslookup` to verify DNS record:
   ```bash
   nslookup -type=TXT disasterrecovery.com.au
   ```
4. Try alternative verification method (HTML meta tag)

### Issue 2: Sitemap Not Indexing

**Symptoms:** "Couldn't fetch" error on sitemap submission

**Solutions:**
1. Test sitemap manually: https://disasterrecovery.com.au/sitemap.xml
2. Ensure robots.txt allows crawling (already configured)
3. Check for XML syntax errors
4. Wait 24-48 hours for Google to retry fetch
5. Manually request indexing for critical pages

### Issue 3: Google Business Profile Suspended

**Symptoms:** Profile suspended or disabled after creation

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure business name doesn't include keywords (NRPG is clean)
2. Don't use PO Box for address (service area business doesn't need address)
3. Use real phone number (no virtual numbers)
4. Appeal suspension via Google Business Profile Help

### Issue 4: Low Indexing Rate

**Symptoms:** Only 100-200 pages indexed after 2 weeks

**Solutions:**
1. Check Core Web Vitals (slow pages index slower)
2. Ensure pages have unique content (avoid thin content)
3. Manually request indexing for priority pages (10 per day limit)
4. Increase internal linking between pages
5. Build external backlinks to priority pages
