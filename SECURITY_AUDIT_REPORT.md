**Remediation Priority:** HIGH (emergency service must remain available)

### 2.3 Exposed Server Information
**Finding:** X-Powered-By header disabled (good), but need additional hardening
**Risk:** Information disclosure aids attackers

### 2.4 No API Security Layer
**Risk:** Unprotected endpoints if APIs are added
**Remediation:** Implement API security before adding any endpoints

### 2.5 Missing Security Monitoring
**Risk:** Delayed breach detection, no audit trail
**Impact:** Cannot detect or respond to attacks

### 2.6 No Data Encryption at Rest
**Risk:** Data exposure if database compromised
**Impact:** Customer PII exposed

### 2.7 Missing WAF Configuration
**Risk:** No protection against OWASP Top 10
**Impact:** Vulnerable to common web attacks

## 3. Medium Priority Issues

### 3.1 No Privacy Policy Implementation
**Legal Risk:** Non-compliance with Privacy Act 1988 (Australia)
**Required:** Privacy policy, cookie consent, data handling procedures

### 3.2 Missing Session Security
**Risk:** Session hijacking, fixation attacks
**Remediation:** Secure session management, token rotation

### 3.3 No File Upload Security
**Risk:** Malicious file uploads if feature added
**Remediation:** File type validation, antivirus scanning, sandboxing

### 3.4 Incomplete Error Handling
**Risk:** Information leakage through error messages
**Remediation:** Generic error messages, secure logging

### 3.5 No Backup Security
**Risk:** Backup exposure, no encryption
**Remediation:** Encrypted backups, secure storage

## 4. Low Priority Issues

### 4.1 No Security.txt File
**Recommendation:** Add /.well-known/security.txt for responsible disclosure

### 4.2 Missing Subresource Integrity (SRI)
**Risk:** CDN compromise
**Remediation:** Add SRI hashes for external resources

### 4.3 No DNS CAA Records
**Risk:** Unauthorized certificate issuance
**Remediation:** Configure CAA records

### 4.4 Missing Security Training Documentation
**Risk:** Human error
**Remediation:** Staff security awareness program

## 5. Compliance Requirements
