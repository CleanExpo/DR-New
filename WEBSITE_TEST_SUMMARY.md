# Website Testing Summary Report
**Test Date**: December 16, 2024
**Test Environment**: http://localhost:3000
**Testing Tool**: Playwright MCP

## Executive Summary
The website has critical issues preventing proper functionality. The main problems are React hydration errors causing full client-side re-renders, API security failures blocking performance tracking, and rate limiting issues from excessive API polling.

## Critical Issues (P0 - Must Fix Immediately)

### 1. React Hydration Errors
- **Location**: Homepage (`HeroPremium.tsx:75`)
- **Impact**: Forces complete client-side re-render, causing 8+ second load times
- **Evidence**: Multiple hydration mismatch errors in console
- **Root Cause**: Server/client component mismatch
- **User Impact**: Extremely poor performance, visible error in mobile view

### 2. Water Damage Page Completely Broken
- **Status**: 500 Internal Server Error
- **Error**: "Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props"
- **Impact**: Page completely unusable
- **Root Cause**: Server component trying to pass onClick handlers to client components

### 3. CSRF Protection Blocking APIs
- **Affected Endpoints**:
  - `/api/performance` (403 Forbidden - 50+ failures)
  - `/api/performance/aggregate` (403 Forbidden)
- **Impact**: No performance tracking or metrics collection
- **Root Cause**: CSRF token validation failing

## High Priority Issues (P1)

### 4. Rate Limiting Being Triggered
- **Endpoint**: `/api/weather/alerts` (429 Too Many Requests)
- **Frequency**: Called 100+ times in a single session
- **Impact**: API blocked after threshold reached
- **Security Logs**: `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` events recorded

### 5. Missing API Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `/api/analytics/standard` (404 Not Found)
- **Impact**: Standard analytics not available
- **Called By**: Analytics dashboard components

### 6. Content Security Policy Violations
- **WebSocket blocked**: `ws://localhost:3001/socket.io/`
- **External media blocked**: W3Schools rain.mp4
- **Impact**: Real-time features and media not working

## Performance Metrics

### Homepage Load Times
- **Initial Load**: 8.3 seconds (POOR)
- **LCP**: 8286ms (should be <2500ms)
- **FCP**: 5602ms (should be <1800ms)
- **TTI**: 6597ms (should be <3800ms)

### Other Pages
- **Services Page**: 2.8 seconds (Better but still slow)
- **FAQ Page**: 1.0 second (Good)
- **Water Damage**: Crashes with 500 error

## Mobile Testing Results
- **Viewport**: 375x812 (iPhone size)
- **Issue**: Error message visible in mobile view
- **Hydration errors persist in mobile**
- **Images loading correctly** (fire-smoke-damage-restoration.jpg, mould-remediation-services.jpg)

## API Health Status
| Endpoint | Status | Issues |
|----------|--------|--------|
| `/api/analytics/realtime` | ✅ 200 OK | Excessive polling |
| `/api/weather/alerts` | ⚠️ 200/429 | Rate limited after threshold |
| `/api/performance` | ❌ 403 | CSRF validation failed |
| `/api/analytics/standard` | ❌ 404 | Not implemented |

## Build & Compilation
- **Initial compilation**: 4.3 seconds (2231 modules)
- **Hot reload working**: Fast refresh active
- **TypeScript**: Compiling successfully
- **Warnings**: metadataBase not set for social images

## Recommended Fix Priority

### Immediate Actions (Today)
1. **Fix Hydration Error**
   - Review `HeroPremium.tsx` for dynamic content
   - Add `suppressHydrationWarning` where needed
   - Ensure consistent server/client rendering

2. **Fix Water Damage Page**
   - Convert to client component or
   - Remove onClick handlers from server components

3. **Fix CSRF Protection**
   - Check middleware configuration
   - Implement proper token generation/validation

### Next Actions (This Week)
4. **Reduce API Polling**
   - Implement proper intervals (5-10 seconds minimum)
   - Use WebSocket for real-time data
   - Add request debouncing

5. **Update CSP Headers**
   - Allow WebSocket connections
   - Configure media sources properly

6. **Implement Missing Endpoints**
   - Create `/api/analytics/standard`
   - Document all API endpoints

## Testing Coverage
✅ Homepage navigation
✅ Multiple page routes tested
✅ Error detection and logging
✅ API endpoint verification
✅ Mobile responsiveness check
✅ Image loading verification
✅ Network request analysis
✅ Console error monitoring

## Conclusion
The website has severe technical issues that need immediate attention. The hydration error is the most critical as it affects all users and causes extremely poor performance. The water-damage page being completely broken is also critical for a disaster recovery service website.

**Recommendation**: Fix P0 issues before any production deployment. The current state would result in poor user experience and potential loss of emergency customers needing immediate help.
