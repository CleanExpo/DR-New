      icon: FileText,
      questions: [
        {
          q: "Do you work directly with insurance companies?",
          a: "Yes, we're preferred contractors for major insurers including IAG (NRMA, CGU, SGIO), Suncorp (AAMI, GIO), QBE, RACQ, Allianz, and others. We handle the entire claims process on your behalf."
        },
        {
          q: "Will you help with my insurance claim?",
          a: "Absolutely. We provide detailed documentation, photos, moisture readings, and comprehensive reports that insurance companies require. We liaise directly with your insurer and loss adjuster to streamline the process."

          q: "What if I don't have insurance?",

      icon: AlertTriangle,
      questions: [
        {
          q: "How long does water damage restoration take?",
          a: "Most residential water damage restoration takes 3-5 days for drying, depending on the extent of damage. Complete restoration including repairs may take 1-2 weeks. We provide detailed timelines after our initial assessment."
        },
        {
          q: "Can you save my carpets and furniture?",
          a: "In many cases, yes. If we respond quickly (within 24-48 hours), we can often save carpets, rugs, and furniture through professional extraction, drying, and cleaning. Each situation is assessed individually."
        },
        {
          q: "How do you prevent mould after water damage?",
          a: "We use industrial dehumidifiers, air movers, and antimicrobial treatments. We monitor moisture levels daily and don't consider a job complete until materials reach safe moisture content levels (usually below 16%)."

      category: "Mould Remediation",
      icon: Shield,
      questions: [
        {
          q: "Is mould dangerous to my health?",
          a: "Yes, mould can cause respiratory issues, allergies, and other health problems, especially for children, elderly, and those with compromised immune systems. Professional remediation is essential for safe removal."
        },
        {
          q: "How long does mould remediation take?",
          a: "Small areas (under 10mÂ²) typically take 1-2 days. Larger infestations may require 3-5 days or more. We contain the area, remove affected materials, treat surfaces, and verify clearance with testing."
        },
        {
          q: "Will the mould come back?",
          a: "When properly remediated and the moisture source is eliminated, mould should not return. We address the root cause, not just visible growth, and provide prevention recommendations."
