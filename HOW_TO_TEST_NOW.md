```
Professional water damage mitigation deployment utilizing IICRC S500-compliant
restoration equipment including DryAir inflatable air chamber drying mat system
and industrial-grade dehumidification unit. Affected timber flooring substrate
exhibits visible moisture infiltration requiring controlled environmental drying
conditions established through polyethylene containment barrier installation per
AS/NZS 3760 safety protocols. Equipment configuration demonstrates adherence to
structured drying methodology with optimised airflow pathways and moisture
extraction systems to prevent secondary microbial colonisation and progressive
structural timber degradation in accordance with Australian building code
requirements.
