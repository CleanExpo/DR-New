  'Water Damage': [
    {
      question: "How quickly should I act after water damage?",
      answer: "Immediately. Call a professional restoration team within the first 24-48 hours. Swift action prevents mould growth and structural damage. NRPG offers 24/7 emergency response with an average response time of 42 minutes across Australian capitals."
    },
    {
      question: "Will insurance cover water damage restoration?",
      answer: "Most standard home and contents insurance policies cover sudden water damage from burst pipes or storms. However, damage from poor maintenance, gradual leaks, or flooding may not be covered. We help navigate insurance claims with professional documentation and direct billing options."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does water damage restoration take?",
      answer: "Timeline depends on damage extent. Minor water damage takes 3-7 days. Moderate damage: 7-14 days. Severe damage: 4-8 weeks. We provide detailed timelines after initial assessment. IICRC-certified teams follow industry standards for drying, cleaning, and restoration."
    },
    {
      question: "What does water damage restoration cost?",
      answer: "Our emergency response fee is $2,750 (including GST) for immediate assessment, extraction, and make-safe work. Additional services (drying, cleaning, repairs) are quoted based on damage scope. Most insurance claims cover 90%+ of costs."
    },
    {
      question: "Can water-damaged items be saved?",
      answer: "Many items can be restored depending on water type and exposure duration. Clean water (burst pipes) has better recovery rates than grey water (appliances) or black water (sewage). Our restoration team specialises in content recovery including documents, furniture, and electronics."
    }
  ],
  'Fire & Smoke': [
    {
      question: "Is my home safe after a fire?",
      answer: "Never re-enter a fire-damaged property without professional assessment. Structural integrity, smoke damage, and hazardous materials must be evaluated by certified professionals. NRPG provides comprehensive safety assessments as part of emergency response."
    },
    {
      question: "How do professionals remove smoke smell?",
      answer: "Smoke odour requires multi-stage treatment: air circulation, thermal fogging to neutralise odours, ozone treatment (when safe), and deep cleaning of surfaces, HVAC systems, and ductwork. IICRC-certified teams follow proven protocols for complete odour elimination."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between fire restoration and cleanup?",
      answer: "Cleanup removes debris. Restoration includes damage assessment, structural repairs, smoke treatment, content restoration, and rebuild to pre-loss condition. Full restoration is covered by insurance and ensures your home is truly restored, not just cleaned."
    },
    {
      question: "How long until I can return home?",
      answer: "For minor fire damage: 2-4 weeks. Moderate: 4-12 weeks. Severe: 3-6 months depending on structural damage. We coordinate with insurance and provide temporary accommodation solutions. Safety assessments determine when areas become habitable."
    },
    {
      question: "Are soot and ash hazardous?",
      answer: "Yes. Fire byproducts contain potentially hazardous particles and chemicals. Professional cleaning prevents respiratory issues and contamination spread. We use HEPA filtration, negative pressure systems, and certified cleaning protocols."
    }
  ],
  'Mould': [
    {
      question: "How do I know if I have mould?",
      answer: "Signs include: musty odours, visible growth (black, green, or white spots), water stains, peeling paint, or respiratory symptoms. Professional mould inspection identifies hidden growth behind walls. Early detection prevents health issues and structural damage."
    },
    {
      question: "Is all mould dangerous?",
      answer: "All mould can trigger allergies and respiratory issues, especially in children, elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Some species produce toxins. Professional remediation removes all mould and treats the underlying moisture problem to prevent recurrence."
    },
    {
      question: "How does mould remediation differ from cleaning?",
      answer: "Cleaning removes visible mould. Remediation includes moisture control, containment, complete removal, HEPA filtration, and verification testing. Only professional remediation addresses root causes and prevents mould return."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does mould remediation cost?",
      answer: "Small areas: $500-$1,500. Medium: $1,500-$3,000. Large/structural: $3,000+. Costs depend on extent and complexity. Many insurance policies cover mould remediation if caused by covered perils (water damage, storm)."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I prevent mould?",
      answer: "Maintain humidity 30-50% using dehumidifiers. Fix leaks immediately. Ensure adequate ventilation in bathrooms and kitchens. Use exhaust fans. Insulate cold surfaces. Regular inspections catch moisture problems early before mould develops."
    }
  ],
  'Storm': [
    {
      question: "What should I do immediately after a storm?",
      answer: "1) Ensure safety (downed power lines, structural damage). 2) Document damage with photos/video. 3) Make temporary repairs to prevent further damage. 4) Contact your insurance company and a professional restoration team like NRPG for assessment."
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly do professional storm assessments happen?",
      answer: "NRPG prioritises rapid response across all service areas. Weather conditions may delay assessment, but requests are triaged based on safety risk. Comprehensive assessments guide repair planning and insurance claims."
    },
    {
      question: "Does insurance cover storm damage?",
      answer: "Most policies cover storm damage (hail, wind, lightning, falling trees). Deductibles typically apply. Professional documentation improves claim approval. We provide detailed damage reports, before/after photos, and cost estimates for insurance submission."
    },
    {
      question: "What repairs are covered under storm damage?",
      answer: "Sudden, direct damage from storms (roof damage, broken windows, water damage from wind-driven rain) is typically covered. Preventable damage from poor maintenance or lack of weatherproofing may not be covered. We advise on coverage specifics for your situation."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I prevent storm damage?",
      answer: "Maintain roof integrity. Trim tree branches near structures. Secure outdoor items. Install impact-resistant windows in high-risk areas. Check gutters and drainage. Regular maintenance reduces vulnerability. We recommend annual pre-storm inspections for properties in storm-prone regions."
    }
  ],
  'Sewage': [
    {
      question: "Is sewage backup coverage included in standard insurance?",
      answer: "Sewage backup is often excluded from standard policies. You may need a separate endorsement (\"sewer backup rider\"). Professional sewage cleanup is expensive ($5,000-$30,000+) depending on extent. We advise checking your policy and considering additional coverage."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the health risks of sewage exposure?",
      answer: "Exposure risks include bacterial infections (E. coli, hepatitis A), viral illnesses, and parasites. Professional cleanup requires hazmat-level protocols, specialized equipment, and certified technicians. Never attempt DIY sewage cleanup."
    },
    {
      question: "How is sewage cleanup different from standard cleaning?",
      answer: "Sewage cleanup requires containment, hazmat protocols, complete removal of contaminated materials, professional disinfection, and often structural repairs. Standard cleaners cannot handle biohazard contamination. Only certified teams should perform this work."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does sewage remediation take?",
      answer: "Minor backups: 3-5 days. Moderate damage: 5-14 days. Severe contamination: 2-4 weeks. Timeline depends on affected area, materials affected, and structural damage. We provide detailed timelines and coordinate with insurance adjusters."
    },
    {
      question: "What preventive measures reduce sewage backup risk?",
      answer: "Regular drain maintenance, avoid flushing non-toilet items, inspect pipes for tree root intrusion, install backwater valves, maintain septic systems, and ensure proper grading away from structures. These measures significantly reduce backup risk."
    }
  ],
  'Biohazard': [
    {
      question: "What qualifies as biohazard cleanup?",
      answer: "Biohazard cleanup includes bodily fluids, blood, medical waste, and other potentially infectious materials. This includes crime scenes, unattended deaths, accidents, and medical emergencies. Only certified biohazard specialists should handle cleanup."
    },
    {
      question: "Is biohazard cleanup covered by insurance?",
      answer: "Homeowners insurance typically doesn't cover biohazard cleanup. Specialised crime scene cleanup insurance may be available. Many families access support through victim assistance programs. We provide transparent pricing and work with families during difficult times."
    },
    {
      question: "Why can't family members do the cleanup?",
      answer: "Family members face health risks from bloodborne pathogens, emotional trauma, and potential legal issues regarding infectious material disposal. Professional teams use OSHA-compliant protocols, proper equipment, and safe disposal methods. Let professionals handle this difficult work."
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly can biohazard cleanup be performed?",
      answer: "We respond 24/7 and can often begin cleanup within hours. Quick response protects other family members, prevents emotional strain from delayed cleanup, and reduces biohazard risk. Our team handles the entire process with sensitivity and professionalism."
    },
    {
      question: "How is the property made safe after biohazard cleanup?",
      answer: "Beyond visible cleanup, we perform disinfection, deodorisation, and verify safety through professional-grade testing. We work within local regulations regarding medical waste disposal. Our goal is returning the space to safe, habitable condition."
