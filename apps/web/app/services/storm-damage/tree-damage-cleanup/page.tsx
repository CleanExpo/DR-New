const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Who pays for tree damage to my property?",
    answer:
      "Generally, your home insurance covers damage to your property from fallen trees regardless of where the tree originated. If a neighbour's tree falls on your property, your own insurance typically covers the structural damage while the tree removal may be shared. We help document everything for your claim.",
  },
  {
    question: "A neighbour's tree has damaged my property. What are my rights?",
    answer:
      "In most Australian states, if a neighbour's tree was clearly dead, diseased, or poorly maintained and they were previously notified, they may be liable for damages. Your home insurance typically covers the immediate damage regardless. We provide detailed arborist reports that can support liability claims.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are council responsibilities for public tree damage?",
    answer:
      "Local councils are responsible for trees on public land including nature strips, parks, and easements. If a council tree damages your property, the council may be liable, particularly if the tree was known to be hazardous. We coordinate directly with councils on your behalf.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can damaged trees be saved after a storm?",
    answer:
      "Some storm-damaged trees can be saved through professional pruning, bracing, and crown restoration. Our arborist partners assess tree viability, considering species, extent of damage, structural integrity, and risk to property. Salvageable trees are identified during the initial assessment.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a structural assessment after a tree strikes my property?",
    answer:
      "Yes, a structural assessment is strongly recommended after any tree impact, even if damage appears minor. Tree strikes can cause hidden damage to roof trusses, wall framing, and foundations that may not be immediately visible but can compromise structural integrity over time.",
