    question: "What are my legal obligations as a building owner regarding mould?",
    answer:
      "Building owners and employers have a duty of care under workplace health and safety legislation to provide a safe working environment. This includes addressing known mould contamination, responding to occupant complaints, and maintaining building systems to prevent moisture and mould issues. Failure to act can result in WorkSafe investigations and liability claims.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can employees refuse to work in a mouldy building?",
    answer:
      "Under Australian workplace health and safety law, workers can cease work if they have a reasonable concern that continuing work would expose them to a serious health risk. If mould contamination poses a genuine health risk, employees may be within their rights to refuse to work in the affected area until remediation is completed.",

  {
    question: "Can you perform remediation after hours to minimise disruption?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We offer after-hours, weekend, and staged remediation programmes specifically designed for commercial properties. Our teams can work outside business hours to minimise impact on your operations, tenants, and customers. We coordinate directly with building management to schedule access.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle mould in multi-tenant buildings?",
    answer:
      "Multi-tenant remediation requires careful coordination with building management, strata committees, and individual tenants. We establish containment to prevent cross-contamination between tenancies, coordinate access schedules, and provide documentation for each affected area. Communication plans keep all stakeholders informed throughout the process.",
  },
  {
    question: "What compliance documentation do you provide?",
    answer:
      "We provide comprehensive documentation including initial assessment reports, safe work method statements, risk assessments, remediation completion certificates, independent clearance testing results, and photographic records. This documentation satisfies WorkSafe, insurance, and building management requirements.",
