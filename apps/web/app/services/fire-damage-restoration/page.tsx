  {
    question: 'How long does fire restoration take?',
    answer: 'Timeline depends on damage severity. Minor smoke damage may resolve in 3–7 days. Moderate structural damage typically takes 2–6 weeks. Major fires requiring full reconstruction can span 3–12 months. IICRC FSRT-certified assessors provide a written scope and estimated timeline during the initial assessment.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does homeowners insurance cover fire restoration?',
    answer: 'Most standard Australian home and contents policies cover fire damage restoration costs, including debris removal, structural repairs, smoke odour removal, and temporary accommodation. Policy conditions vary between insurers including NRMA, Suncorp, Allianz, QBE, IAG, and CGU. Review your Product Disclosure Statement or speak with your insurer directly.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What causes smoke odour and how do you remove it?',
    answer: 'Smoke odour is caused by microscopic particles and volatile compounds that penetrate porous surfaces — timber, plaster, carpet, and soft furnishings. Certified contractors using IICRC FSRT protocols remove odour through a combination of HEPA vacuuming, hydroxyl generation, ozone treatment, thermal fogging, and encapsulation of sealed surfaces. Surface cleaning alone rarely eliminates deep-set smoke odour.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I DIY fire cleanup?',
    answer: 'DIY fire cleanup is not recommended and can be hazardous. Fire-damaged properties may contain carcinogenic soot, asbestos (in older homes), structural instability, compromised electrical wiring, and toxic chemical residues. Under NSW and VIC fire codes, structural work following fire events must be assessed by qualified professionals. IICRC FSRT-certified contractors have the equipment, training, and insurance required for safe remediation.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How soon should I start restoration after a fire?',
    answer: 'Restoration should begin as soon as emergency services clear the property for access — ideally within 24–48 hours. Delay allows smoke residue to permanently stain surfaces, acidic byproducts to corrode metals and etch glass, and moisture from firefighting water to promote secondary mould growth. Early assessment also preserves evidence for insurance claims.',
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between IICRC and non-certified contractors?",
    answer: 'IICRC FSRT (Fire & Smoke Restoration Technician) certification verifies a contractor has completed structured training in fire chemistry, smoke behaviour, odour removal, and restoration documentation to IICRC S200 Standard. Non-certified contractors lack standardised protocols and may use incorrect cleaning agents that set stains, miss hidden damage, or produce reports insufficient for insurance claim purposes. Each contractor on the platform holds their own IICRC certification independently.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you work directly with insurers?',
    answer: 'The platform facilitates matching property owners with vetted, IICRC-certified contractors. Those contractors are experienced in producing insurance-grade documentation, scope reports, and photographic evidence compatible with major Australian insurers including NRMA, Suncorp, Allianz, QBE, IAG, and CGU. The platform does not control claim outcomes or act as a claim advocate — that is a matter between you, your insurer, and your contractor.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if my property has hidden fire or smoke damage?',
    answer: 'Hidden damage is common after fires. Smoke travels through wall cavities, roof spaces, and HVAC ducting, depositing residue far from the burn origin. Certified assessors use thermal imaging, air quality testing, and visual inspection of concealed spaces to identify hidden damage. Under AFCA complaint guidelines, insurers are required to assess the full scope of damage — not just visible surface loss.',

              How Fire Damage Restoration Works
            </h2>
            <p className="text-[#9CA3AF] mb-10">
              Fire restoration follows a structured process aligned to the IICRC S200 Standard. Each phase is documented for insurance purposes, and work is performed by contractors holding IICRC FSRT certification independently.

                  Immediate Assessment (First 4 Hours)
                </h3>
                <p className="text-[#9CA3AF]">
                  Once emergency services clear the property, a certified assessor conducts a fire restoration assessment to document structural damage, smoke penetration, and water ingress from firefighting operations. This initial report forms the foundation of the insurance claim scope. Photographs, moisture readings, and air quality samples are collected to establish a pre-restoration baseline. Properties that have sustained structural fire damage are secured with emergency board-up, tarping, or temporary fencing to prevent further deterioration and unauthorised access.

                  Containment &amp; Decontamination (24–72 Hours)
                </h3>
                <p className="text-[#9CA3AF]">
                  Soot and smoke residue are acidic and corrosive — within 24–72 hours they permanently etch glass, discolour grout, corrode metal fixtures, and penetrate timber grain. Containment zones are established to prevent cross-contamination of unaffected areas. IICRC FSRT-certified technicians then begin decontamination: HEPA vacuuming of loose particulates, dry chemical sponging of soot from walls and ceilings, and cleaning of HVAC systems to prevent smoke odour recirculation. Charred structural materials are removed and catalogued for insurance documentation. Firefighting water — a common secondary hazard — is extracted using the same protocols as a standard water damage event to prevent mould formation.

                </h3>
                <p className="text-[#9CA3AF]">
                  Following decontamination, the scope of structural repair is confirmed with the insurer. Certified contractors coordinate all required trades — structural carpentry, electrical, plumbing, plastering, and painting — under a single scope of works. Final air quality testing and odour clearance testing confirm the property meets habitable standards before reinstatement. A full completion report with before/after documentation is produced for the insurance file.

              IICRC FSRT Certification: What It Means for Your Claim
            </h2>
            <p className="text-[#9CA3AF] mb-6">
              IICRC FSRT — Fire &amp; Smoke Restoration Technician — is the internationally recognised certification standard for fire and smoke restoration work. It is distinct from other IICRC certifications: FSRT covers fire chemistry, smoke behaviour, odour removal chemistry, and documentation protocols. S520 is the mould remediation standard and has no overlap.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#9CA3AF] mb-6">
              The IICRC S200 Standard for Professional Fire &amp; Smoke Damage Restoration sets the methodology all certified contractors follow. Insurers including NRMA, Suncorp, Allianz, QBE, IAG, and CGU increasingly require IICRC FSRT certification as a condition of approving scopes of works submitted by restoration contractors.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#9CA3AF] mb-6">
              Using a non-certified contractor risks claim disputes, scope rejections, and callbacks for incomplete remediation. Each contractor matched through the platform holds IICRC FSRT certification independently and maintains their own professional indemnity insurance.
