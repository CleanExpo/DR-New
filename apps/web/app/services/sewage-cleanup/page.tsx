  {
    question: 'Is sewage backup covered by home insurance?',
    answer: 'Sudden and accidental sewage backup is typically covered under most Australian home and contents policies. Gradual backup from a known, neglected issue may be excluded. Where a council sewer main caused the backup, council liability may apply — contact the relevant council and your insurer separately. Review your Product Disclosure Statement with major insurers including NRMA, Suncorp, Allianz, QBE, IAG, and CGU for exact conditions.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can sewage be cleaned up without a professional contractor?',
    answer: 'Not recommended for anything beyond a very minor toilet overflow. Full Category 3 PPE — respirator, chemical-resistant suit, and gloves — is required. EPA disposal regulations apply to solid biohazard waste. Spreading contaminated material through an uncontained property is a common outcome of unqualified attempts. Insurance claims for sewage events typically require IICRC S500-documented remediation to be accepted.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What materials get removed after a sewage backup?',
    answer: 'All porous materials that have contacted sewage must be removed: carpet, underlay, gyprock (to at least 300mm above the waterline), insulation, and any timber that has absorbed contaminated water. Hard surfaces — tiles, sealed concrete — can typically be decontaminated in place. Furniture and contents are assessed case by case depending on material and extent of exposure.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does sewage cleanup take?',
    answer: 'A minor bathroom overflow typically resolves in 2–5 days of remediation. Major sewage backup affecting multiple rooms or a subfloor can take 1–3 weeks for full Category 3 remediation. Rebuild of removed gyprock, flooring, and cabinetry is a separate timeline determined by the scope of works agreed with the insurer.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the health risks of sewage exposure?',
    answer: 'Sewage classified as IICRC Category 3 (black water) contains pathogenic organisms including E. coli, Hepatitis A virus, norovirus, Salmonella, and Cryptosporidium. Symptoms of exposure include gastroenteritis, hepatitis, and skin infections. At-risk groups — elderly persons, immunocompromised individuals, and children — should not enter affected areas under any circumstances until clearance testing confirms decontamination is complete.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does sewage odour go away without treatment?',
    answer: 'No. Odour-causing bacteria remain active in affected materials and surfaces. Masking agents such as bleach or commercial deodorisers do not address the pathogenic source and can create the false impression of successful decontamination. Professional treatment using hydroxyl generation or ozone treatment eliminates odour compounds at the molecular level, and is paired with complete antimicrobial decontamination.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if the sewage came from the council drain?',
    answer: 'Councils may carry liability where their infrastructure — a blocked or collapsed council sewer main — caused the backup. Document the property condition thoroughly before any cleanup begins. Notify both the council and your insurer, as liability may be shared or disputed. If liability is contested between parties, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) can assist at afca.org.au.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How can sewage backup be prevented?',
    answer: 'CCTV drain inspection every 5–10 years identifies tree root ingress and pipe deterioration before a backup occurs — particularly important in older Australian suburbs with large street trees and earthenware pipe infrastructure. Avoid flushing wipes, sanitary items, or cooking fat. Commercial kitchens should maintain grease traps. Rural properties on septic systems should have annual tank inspections and monitor drainfield condition.',

              How Sewage Cleanup Works

            <p className="text-[#9CA3AF] mb-10">
              Sewage events require immediate Category 3 containment — spread of contaminated material must be halted before extraction begins.
            </p>

            <div className="space-y-8">

                  Phase 1: Containment &amp; Site Assessment (First 2 Hours)
                </h3>
                <p className="text-[#9CA3AF]">
                  The sewage source must be stopped before remediation can begin — a licenced plumber is typically required to clear the blockage or repair the damaged line. Containment barriers are established to prevent contaminated material tracking into unaffected areas of the property. Technicians don full Category 3 PPE before entering the affected zone. The extent of contamination is mapped, a structural safety check is completed, and electrical isolation is carried out where sewage has reached switchboard proximity.

                </h3>
                <p className="text-[#9CA3AF]">
                  Sewage water is extracted using specialist wet extraction equipment rated for Category 3 material. All porous materials that have contacted sewage are removed — carpet, underlay, gyprock to at least 300mm above the waterline, insulation, and affected timber. Solid waste is double-bagged and disposed of in accordance with EPA guidelines for biohazard waste in the relevant state. Material removal is documented photographically for the insurance scope of works.

                </h3>
                <p className="text-[#9CA3AF]">
                  All remaining hard surfaces — tiles, concrete slabs, timber framing that was not removed — are treated with EPA-registered biocides applied at label-specified concentrations. HEPA air scrubbers run continuously during decontamination to capture airborne pathogens. Structural drying follows the S500 protocol using commercial dehumidifiers and air movers until moisture readings confirm structural materials have returned to acceptable levels. Odour treatment using hydroxyl generation or ozone is applied, and final pathogen clearance testing confirms the property is safe for reinstatement.

                  Tree root ingress is the most common cause in older Australian suburbs where large street trees — fig, camphor laurel, liquidambar — have roots that seek moisture in earthenware pipe joints. Grease buildup from kitchen discharge, collapsed earthenware pipes (common in pre-1980 properties), and blockages in the council sewer main connecting to the property all produce the same outcome: sewage flowing back through floor wastes and toilets.

              Why IICRC S500 Category 3 Certification Matters
            </h2>
            <p className="text-[#9CA3AF] mb-6">
              Category 3 is the highest hazard classification under IICRC S500. It carries legal obligations that do not apply to Category 1 or 2 water events. Solid biohazard waste must be disposed of per state EPA guidelines — contractors without Category 3 certification may not understand the disposal chain, creating liability for the property owner.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#9CA3AF] mb-6">
              Using an unqualified contractor for a sewage event creates direct liability risks: cross-contamination from inadequate containment, incomplete material removal leaving pathogens in the structure, and the production of documentation insufficient for insurers. Major Australian insurers including NRMA, Suncorp, Allianz, QBE, IAG, and CGU are increasingly requiring IICRC S500 Category 3 documentation as a condition of claim acceptance for sewage events.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#9CA3AF] mb-6">
              Each contractor matched through the platform holds IICRC S500 certification independently and maintains their own professional indemnity insurance and trade licences.

              Australian Insurance Claims Process for Sewage Events

              Sudden sewage backup events — including from blocked or collapsed sewer lines — are typically covered under standard Australian home and contents policies. Gradual leaks arising from known maintenance issues that were not addressed are commonly excluded. Where the council sewer caused the event, the property owner should contact both their insurer and the council separately, as liability may be shared.
