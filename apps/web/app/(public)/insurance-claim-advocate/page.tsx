/**
 * BUILD-004: Professional Documentation for Insurance Claims
 *
 * Correct framing per Phill McGurk (6 April 2026):
 * NRPG/DR are specialist restoration service companies. They perform works,
 * provide reports, scopes of works, and estimates — to IICRC best practice
 * and Australian standards. Whether the client is reimbursed by their insurer
 * is between the client and their insurer. NRPG does not advocate for claims,
 * determine outcomes, or guarantee reimbursement.
 *
 * Pre-Deploy Checklist:
 * G1 ✅ No "TBD" content — complete.
 * G2 ✅ No legal claims — describes service and documentation only.
 * G3 ✅ No unverified statistics.
 * G5 ✅ ACL s18 compliant — no misleading representations.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md: No phone/email/address — online claim CTA only.
