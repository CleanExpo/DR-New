 * NOTE (launch-readiness remediation): the previous version of this page asserted
 * awards, industry memberships, insurer partnerships and performance metrics that
 * are not substantiated by repo evidence or owner-approved records. Those claims
 * were removed because publishing unverifiable credentials is misleading conduct
 * under the Australian Consumer Law (ACCC).
 *
 * This page is intentionally a minimal, honest stub and is set to noindex until it
 * is rebuilt from owner-verified sources (see verified-claims.json and the
 * DR-NRPG launch-readiness spec). Only add a claim back here once it can be cited
 * to a first-source, owner-approved record.

              Before a contractor appears in our directory they are NRPG-verified: we review their
              IICRC certification and the credentials they provide (such as licence and insurance
              documentation). Contractors are required to hold their own current licensing and
              insurance. Contractors are independent businesses and are not employees or agents of
              NRPG.

              Our contractors work to recognised IICRC standards for restoration, including S500 for
              water damage and S520 for mould remediation. We do not determine insurance claim
              outcomes; you deal directly with your own insurer.
