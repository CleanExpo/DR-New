# MCP Configuration Fix for Claude CLI

## Problem Identified
Claude CLI (Claude Code) was not detecting MCP servers because it looks for configuration in a different location than Claude Desktop.

## Root Cause
- **Claude Desktop** uses: `C:/Users/[username]/AppData/Roaming/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Claude CLI** uses: `C:/Users/[username]/.claude/mcp.json`

## Solution Applied
Created MCP configuration file at the correct location for Claude CLI:
`C:/Users/Disaster Recovery 4/.claude/mcp.json`

## Configuration Details
The following MCP servers have been configured:
1. **Context7 MCP** (v1.0.17) - Documentation and code examples
2. **Sequential Thinking MCP** (latest) - Structured problem-solving
3. **Playwright MCP** (latest) - Browser automation

## Next Steps
1. **Exit current Claude CLI session**: Type `exit` in terminal
2. **Restart Claude CLI**: Run `claude` command
3. **Navigate to project**: `cd "D:\DR New"`
4. **Test MCP availability**: Run `/mcp` command

## Verification
After restarting, the `/mcp` command should show the configured servers.

## Important Notes
- Claude CLI and Claude Desktop use separate configuration files
- Both can coexist without conflicts
- MCP servers require Node.js and npm (verified: Node v20.19.4, npm v10.8.3)
