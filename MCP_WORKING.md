# 🎉 MCP SERVERS NOW WORKING!

## ✅ Current Status
All three MCP servers are **CONNECTED and WORKING**:
- **playwright** - ✓ Connected
- **sequential-thinking** - ✓ Connected
- **context7** - ✓ Connected

## 📝 What Was Done
The MCP servers were added using the Claude CLI commands:
```bash
claude mcp add playwright npx -- -y @playwright/mcp@latest
claude mcp add sequential-thinking npx -- -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking
claude mcp add context7 npx -- -y @upstash/context7-mcp
```

Configuration is saved in: `C:\Users\Disaster Recovery 4\.claude.json`

## 🔄 To Restart Claude CLI with MCP

If you need to restart the Claude CLI session:

1. **Exit current session**: Type `exit` or press `Ctrl+C`
2. **Start new session**: Type `claude` in VS Code terminal
3. **Verify MCP**: Type `/mcp` - should show available servers

## 📋 Verify MCP Status
```bash
# Check MCP servers
claude mcp list

# Should show:
# playwright: npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest - ✓ Connected
# sequential-thinking: npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking - ✓ Connected
# context7: npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp - ✓ Connected
```

## 🚀 Test MCP Servers

Now you can use the MCP servers in Claude CLI:

### Test Playwright:
```
/mcp playwright navigate_browser url:"http://localhost:3000"
```

### Test Sequential Thinking:
```
/mcp sequential-thinking process_thought thought:"How to optimize the disaster recovery website"
```

### Test Context7:
```
/mcp context7 search query:"Next.js App Router"
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Configuration Location**: MCP servers are configured globally for your user in `~/.claude.json`
2. **Project Override**: The `.claude/mcp.json` file in the project is NOT used by Claude CLI
3. **Use Claude CLI Commands**: Always use `claude mcp add` to add servers, not manual config files

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If MCP stops working:
```bash
# Remove and re-add servers
claude mcp remove playwright
claude mcp remove sequential-thinking
claude mcp remove context7

# Re-add them
claude mcp add playwright npx -- -y @playwright/mcp@latest
claude mcp add sequential-thinking npx -- -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking
claude mcp add context7 npx -- -y @upstash/context7-mcp
```
