## Critical Rules

1. **NO PHONE, NO ADDRESS, NO EMAIL DISPLAYED** — The platform is fully AI-automated online. Never display phone numbers, email addresses, street addresses, or business locations anywhere in the UI. All contact/support is handled via the online contact form and AI chat. This applies to all public pages, dashboards, footers, headers, CTAs, and schema visible to users.
2. **Australian English** — colour, mould, organisation, licence, centre
3. **Contractors are independent** — Platform facilitates matching only
4. **Retrieval-First** — Query memory → skills → grep BEFORE loading docs inline
5. **No self-verification** — All work verified by `verification` agent, never the author
6. **State on disk** — Decisions written to `.claude/memory/architectural-decisions.md`
7. **Design system** — Scientific Luxury enforced. OLED black `#050505`. No generic Tailwind defaults.

## OMX Workflow Protocols (DR-324)

> Ports patterns from oh-my-codex into Claude-native workflow. Applies to all BUILD tasks.

### Pre-BUILD Clarification Gate (`dr-clarify`)

Before ANY build enters "Approved", all 6 gates must be green:

| Gate | Pass Condition |
|------|----------------|
| G1 Content | No "TBD", "pending", or "to be confirmed" sections |
| G2 Legal | Pre-conditions confirmed by named person (not "pending review") |
| G3 Data Sources | Every stat has Tier 1–3 source + direct URL |
| G4 Geo/Supplier | Named supplier confirmed per geography |
| G5 Owner | Specific named individual — not "the team" |
| G6 Execution Date | Specific DD/MM/YYYY — not "next session" |

Failed gate → Status: `Blocked: Clarification Required`. Do not plan.

### BUILD Execution Protocol (`dr-execute`)

After a BUILD is approved + security-cleared:
- Status → **ACTIVE EXECUTION**
- Next session: must present completion evidence (URL live / TypeScript passes / PR merged)
- No evidence after 2 sessions → **P0 EXECUTION BLOCKER** (named dev + commit SHA + 24-hour deadline)
- No re-planning of ACTIVE builds — only: Complete | Blocked (specific reason) | Scope-Changed (new ID)

### RALPLAN-DR Block (P0/P1 BUILDs — `dr-execute`)

Every P0/P1 BUILD plan must include a RALPLAN-DR summary block before execution:

```markdown
## RALPLAN-DR: [BUILD-XXX]
### Principles (3–5)
### Decision Drivers (top 3)
### Options Evaluated (≥2 with pros/cons)
### Selected Approach + Rationale
### Antithesis (strongest argument against this approach)
### Test Acceptance Criteria (how we know it's done)
### Pre-mortem (3 scenarios where this fails — P0/security builds only)
```

A plan without a RALPLAN-DR block is not approved for P0/P1 BUILDs.

### Parallel Lanes (`$team`)

Every BUILD with ≥2 independent tasks must define explicit execution lanes. Never build sequentially what can build in parallel.

### Session Continuity

Read `docs/boardroom-state.json` first at boardroom session start (5 seconds). Write it at session end.

### Skill Files

`.claude/skills/dr/` contains 4 OMX-ported skills:
- `dr-clarify.md` — Pre-BUILD ambiguity gate
- `dr-execute.md` — BUILD completion loop
- `dr-content-build.md` — Autonomous content pipeline
- `dr-competitor-page.md` — Competitor page extraction

---

## Drift Recovery

If context feels wrong, re-read in order:
```bash
cat .claude/memory/CONSTITUTION.md
cat .claude/memory/current-state.md
cat .claude/memory/architectural-decisions.md
```

## Karpathy-Inspired Coding Guidelines

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
