# MCP Servers Resolution Guide

## üö® Current Issue
**MCP servers are showing as "not configured" because you're using Claude Code (web version) instead of Claude Desktop.**

## ‚úÖ Complete Solution

### Understanding the Problem
- **Claude Code** (claude.ai/code) - Web-based, does NOT support MCP servers yet
- **Claude Desktop** - Desktop app, DOES support MCP servers
- Your configuration is correct, but needs Claude Desktop to work

### Step-by-Step Resolution

#### Step 1: Install Claude Desktop
1. Download from: https://claude.ai/desktop
2. Install the desktop application
3. Sign in with your Anthropic account

#### Step 2: Configuration (Already Complete)
Your project already has proper MCP configuration:

**Project-level config** (`.claude/mcp.json`):
- ‚úÖ Playwright MCP configured
- ‚úÖ Context7 MCP configured
- ‚úÖ Sequential Thinking MCP configured

**Desktop config** (`claude_desktop_config.json`):
- ‚úÖ All MCP servers configured with proper settings
- ‚úÖ Multiple Playwright modes (default, headed, isolated)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced Sequential Thinking from GitHub

#### Step 3: Install Configuration
Run the fix script to ensure everything is in place:
```bash
fix-mcp-setup.bat
```

This script will:
- Create Claude Desktop config directory
- Copy configuration to `%APPDATA%\Claude\`
- Install MCP server packages
- Test MCP server availability

#### Step 4: Launch Claude Desktop
1. Open Claude Desktop (not the web version)
2. Open your project folder: `D:\DR New`
3. MCP servers should now be available

#### Step 5: Verify MCP is Working
In Claude Desktop, type:
```
/mcp
```

You should see:
- playwright
- context7
- sequential-thinking
- (and other configured servers)

### Quick Test Commands

Once MCP is working in Claude Desktop:

**Playwright MCP:**
```
Navigate to localhost:3000 and take a screenshot
```

**Sequential Thinking MCP:**
```
Use sequential thinking to analyze the disaster recovery website architecture
```

**Context7 MCP:**
```
Use Context7 to look up Next.js App Router documentation
```

## üìã Configuration Files Overview

### 1. `.claude/mcp.json` (Project-specific)
- Location: `D:\DR New\.claude\mcp.json`
- Purpose: Project-level MCP configuration
- Status: ‚úÖ Configured

### 2. `claude_desktop_config.json` (Desktop app)
- Location: `D:\DR New\claude_desktop_config.json`
- Destination: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- Purpose: Claude Desktop MCP servers
- Status: ‚úÖ Configured

### 3. Files Created for Setup:
- `fix-mcp-setup.bat` - Automated setup script
- `setup-playwright-mcp.bat` - Playwright-specific setup
- `setup-sequential-thinking.bat` - Sequential Thinking setup
- `test-all-mcps.bat` - Test all MCP servers

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If MCP still doesn't work after Claude Desktop installation:

1. **Check Node.js Installation**
   ```bash
   node --version  # Should be 18+
   npm --version   # Should be installed
   ```

2. **Reinstall MCP Packages**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @playwright/mcp@latest
   npm install -g @upstash/context7-mcp
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking
   ```

3. **Check Configuration Location**
   ```bash
   dir %APPDATA%\Claude\
   ```
   Should show `claude_desktop_config.json`

4. **Windows Security**
   - Check Windows Defender isn't blocking
   - Add Node.js to firewall exceptions
   - Run as administrator if needed

5. **Clear Cache and Restart**
   - Close Claude Desktop completely
   - Clear any cache: `%APPDATA%\Claude\Cache`
   - Restart Claude Desktop

### Alternative: Standalone MCP Server
If you need to stay with Claude Code (web), you can run MCP servers standalone:

```bash
# Start standalone server on port
npx @playwright/mcp@latest --port 8931

# Then configure Claude Code to connect to:
# http://localhost:8931/mcp
```

## üìä Current Status

| Component | Status | Action Needed |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| MCP Configuration Files | ‚úÖ Complete | None |

| MCP Packages | ‚úÖ Available | None |
| Claude Desktop | ‚ùå Not installed | Install from claude.ai/desktop |
| MCP in Claude Code | ‚ùå Not supported | Switch to Claude Desktop |

## üéØ Next Actions

1. **Immediate**: Install Claude Desktop from https://claude.ai/desktop
2. **After Installation**: Run `fix-mcp-setup.bat`
3. **Launch**: Open Claude Desktop (not web)
4. **Test**: Type `/mcp` to verify servers are available
5. **Use**: Start using MCP tools for browser automation, documentation, and structured thinking

## üìù Summary
