## 🔄 Pending: Professional Icon Generation

### Current Status

**Awaiting**: Gemini 3 Pro API Model Availability

The professional icon generation script is **fully prepared** and ready to execute when the Gemini 3 Pro model becomes available in the Google Generative AI API.

### What's Ready

**Script**: `scripts/generate-professional-icons.js`
- ✅ All 10 icons defined with detailed specifications
- ✅ Brand guidelines injected (colors, style, mood)
- ✅ Automatic SVG output format
- ✅ Professional Modern SaaS aesthetic enforced
- ✅ No playful/toy styles (enterprise-grade only)

**Code Integration**: `lib/ai/design-generator.service.ts`
- ✅ Model configured: `gemini-3-pro` (line 106)
- ✅ API key validated and active
- ✅ Asset directory ready: `public/generated-assets/`
- ✅ Caching system implemented (75% cost reduction)

**Next Steps When Model Available**:
```bash
# Execute icon generation
node scripts/generate-professional-icons.js

# Expected output:
# ✅ 10 professional icons generated
# 💰 Cost: $0.05 for full set
# 📁 Saved to: public/generated-assets/
```

### Why Icon Generation is Pending - CRITICAL: API Key Compromised

Professional icon generation is **BLOCKED** due to a **critical security issue**:

**API Security Status** ⚠️ **URGENT**:
- **Model Name**: `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` (correct model for January 2026)
- **Current Status**: 403 Forbidden - API key reported as leaked
- **API Key**: `AIzaSyDruLQXB-vtHNUbbFNEjr3wI0sA3OqdFKM` (from .env.local, line 19) - **DISABLED BY GOOGLE**
- **Error Message**: "Your API key was reported as leaked. Please use another API key."

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**:
1. **Regenerate API Key** (URGENT)
   - Go to: Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials
   - Delete compromised key: `AIzaSyDruLQXB-vtHNUbbFNEjr3wI0sA3OqdFKM`
   - Create new API key with Gemini API access

2. **Update .env.local**
   - Replace line 19 with new API key
   - **DO NOT commit this file** - it contains secrets

3. **Re-run Icon Generation**
   - Once new key is active: `node scripts/generate-professional-icons.js`

**Required to Enable Icon Generation**:
1. **Option A: Upgrade API Key Permissions**
   - Request Gemini 3 Pro access from Google Cloud
   - Update API key in `.env.local` with one that has Gemini 3 Pro permissions
   - Re-run: `node scripts/generate-professional-icons.js`

2. **Option B: Use Alternative API Key**
   - Obtain API key with Gemini 3 Pro access from another Google Cloud project
   - Update `.env.local` line 19 with new key
   - Re-run icon generation script

3. **Option C: Use Google Imagen API** (backup)
   - Different image generation service (separate integration)
   - Would require API wrapper changes

**Once Access is Granted**:
```bash
# Generate all 10 professional icons
node scripts/generate-professional-icons.js

# Expected output:
# ✅ 10 professional icons generated
# 💰 Cost: ~$0.05 for full set
# 📁 Saved to: public/generated-assets/
```

**Note**: This is NOT a blocker for Phase 4 completion or production deployment. The platform is fully functional and live without these icons. Icon generation is a post-launch visual enhancement with estimated 5-10 minute implementation time once API access is available.
