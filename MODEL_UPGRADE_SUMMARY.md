## 🔍 How to Verify the Upgrade

### Check Current Model
The system logs which model is being used. After enhancement, check:

1. **Dashboard:** View enhancement logs
2. **Database:** Check `AIImageEnhancementLog.model` field
3. **API Response:** Model name included in enhancement results

### Test Enhancement Quality
Run a test enhancement and compare:

**GPT-4o Output (before):**
> "Water damage restoration equipment deployed including dehumidifier and air movers for timber floor drying."

**GPT-4.1 Output (after):**
> "Professional water damage mitigation deployment utilizing IICRC S500-compliant restoration equipment including DryAir inflatable air chamber drying mat system and industrial-grade dehumidification unit. Affected timber flooring substrate exhibits visible moisture infiltration requiring controlled environmental drying conditions established through polyethylene containment barrier installation per AS/NZS 3760 safety protocols."

Notice:
