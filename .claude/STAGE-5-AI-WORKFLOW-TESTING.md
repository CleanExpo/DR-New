# Stage 5: AI Workflow Testing - Insurance Knowledge Integration

**Document Purpose**: Test scenarios and validation for enhanced AI workflows with insurance standards integration

**Date**: January 2026
**Status**: Testing Phase
**Workflows Tested**: Claim Processing, Contractor Matching, Customer Support

---

## OVERVIEW: ENHANCEMENTS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Claim Processing Workflow Enhancements
**File**: `lib/agents/workflows/claim-processing.ts`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Minimal system prompt (Snake Build Pattern) referencing insurance standards skill
- ✅ Auto-detection of insurer from policy number format
- ✅ Insurer-specific documentation requirements
- ✅ Code of Practice timeframes (3/10/20/30/120 day rules)
- ✅ AFCA escalation rights in guidance
- ✅ Consumer rights information in final output

**New System Prompt**:
```
"You are an insurance claim specialist for Australian disaster recovery.
Use Australian English. Reference /australian-insurance-standards skill for coverage rules.
Reference /iicrc-validator for damage assessment standards (S500/S520/S540).
Reference /australian-business-validator for pricing and compliance.
Return structured JSON responses only."
```

**New Validation Features**:
- Policy number format detection (NRMA vs Suncorp vs Allianz patterns)
- Code of Practice timeline validation
- Insurer-specific photo requirements (NRMA 2+, Suncorp 3+)
- Returns `detectedInsurer` and `codesOfPracticeNotes`

**Enhanced Guidance Output**:
- "Consumer Rights" field with AFCA escalation info
- "Expect initial response within 10 business days (Insurance Code of Practice)"
- AFCA contact: 1800 931 678

---

### 2. Contractor Matching Workflow Enhancements
**File**: `lib/agents/workflows/contractor-matching.ts`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Database queries now include insurance verification data
- ✅ Public Liability $10M verification checks
- ✅ Insurance training completion status tracking
- ✅ Certificate expiry validation
- ✅ Eligibility flag for insurance-backed work
- ✅ Enhanced scoring with insurance requirements

**New Data Fields Added to Contractor Details**:
```typescript
hasValid10mPL: boolean              // $10M PL verified and not expired
publicLiabilityAmount: string       // "$10,000,000" or amount claimed
publicLiabilityCertExpiry: Date     // Certificate expiry date
insuranceTrainingCompleted: boolean // Module 1-4 all passed
trainingCertificateValid: boolean   // Certificate not expired
trainingCertificateExpiry: Date     // 365 days from completion
certificateLevel: string            // "SILVER" | "GOLD" | "PLATINUM" | "NONE"
```

**Enhanced Scoring Criteria** (Total 100 points):
- Service match: 30 points
- IICRC Certification: 15 points
- Rating & Track Record: 15 points
- Response Time: 10 points
- **Insurance Training (NEW)**: 15 points (Completed & Valid = 15, Expired = 5, Not Done = 0)
- **Public Liability $10M (NEW)**: 10 points (Verified & Valid = 10, Expired = 3, Not Verified = 0)
- Urgency Match: 5 points

**Eligibility Logic**:
```
For INSURANCE-BACKED WORK:
- Insurance Training MUST be Completed AND Valid (not expired)
- Public Liability MUST be $10M+ AND Verified AND Not Expired
- Contractors missing either are INELIGIBLE for insurance work
```

---

### 3. Customer Support Workflow Enhancements
**File**: `lib/agents/workflows/customer-support.ts`

**Changes**:
- ✅ System prompt references `/australian-insurance-standards` skill
- ✅ Intent detection includes insurance-specific intents
- ✅ Knowledge search adapted for insurance queries
- ✅ Response generation includes consumer rights
- ✅ Escalation logic for coverage disputes and AFCA
- ✅ Code of Practice compliance references

**New Insurance-Specific Intent Categories**:
- `insurance_coverage_question` - Queries about what's covered
- `insurance_rights_question` - Queries about consumer rights, AFCA
- `policy_exclusion_question` - Queries about what's NOT covered

**Enhanced Knowledge Search for Insurance Queries**:
- Mandatory vs optional coverage information
- Code of Practice timeframes
- Consumer rights (AFCA, cooling-off period, exclusions)
- Insurer-specific information

**Escalation Triggers for Insurance Queries**:
- Coverage disputes → ESCALATE
- Claims not progressing per Code of Practice timelines → ESCALATE
- AFCA complaint discussion → ESCALATE (Critical)
- Complex consumer rights questions → May escalate

1. "Is my water damage covered by my policy?" → `insurance_coverage_question`
2. "The insurer hasn't responded in 3 weeks" → `insurance_rights_question`
3. "Why isn't my damaged furniture covered?" → `policy_exclusion_question`
4. "Can I escalate to AFCA?" → `insurance_rights_question`
5. "How do I claim?" → `claim_status` (platform, not insurance-specific)

**Expected Output**:
- Query 1-4: `category: "insurance_query"` with specific intent
- Knowledge search references `/australian-insurance-standards`

- `escalationRequired`: true
- `escalationReason`: "Insurance coverage dispute requiring AFCA discussion (critical)"
- `urgency`: "high" or "critical"

✓ Consumer rights emphasized
✓ Empathetic tone throughout

---

#### Test 3.5: Escalation for Unresponsive Insurer

**Input Query**: "It's been 35 days with no response from my insurer, multiple follow-ups made"

**Expected Output**:
- `sentiment`: "urgent" or "negative"
- `escalationRequired`: true
- `escalationReason`: "Claims not progressing per Code of Practice timelines (critical)"

**Success Criteria**:
✓ Code of Practice violation identified
✓ Critical escalation triggered
✓ AFCA information provided
✓ Client empowered with rights knowledge

## INTEGRATION TEST: END-TO-END SCENARIO

### Scenario: Water Damage Claim with Insurance Training Requirements

**Timeline**:
1. **Day 1 - Claim Submission**:
   - Client submits claim via claim-processing workflow
   - Insurer auto-detected as "SUNCORP" from policy number
   - Documentation requirements identified: "3+ photos per damage area"
   - Code of Practice timeline explained: "3-day ack, 10-day response"

2. **Day 4 - Contractor Matching**:
   - NRPG receives request for contractor
   - Contractor-matching workflow evaluates available contractors
   - **Critical Check**: Verify contractor has:
     - Insurance training completed AND valid
     - $10M+ public liability verified AND valid
   - Only eligible contractors recommended for insurance-backed work

3. **Day 10 - Customer Support**:
   - Client calls: "Has the insurer responded? I haven't heard anything"
   - Customer-support workflow recognizes as `claim_status` + insurance query
   - References Code of Practice: "Initial response due within 10 days"
   - Provides AFCA escalation info if needed
   - Knowledge includes: "Expected timeline is 10-day response minimum"

4. **Day 35 - Escalation**:
   - Client contacts again: "Still no response, can I complain to AFCA?"
   - Customer-support workflow identifies AFCA escalation query
   - Triggers escalation to human specialist (critical urgency)
   - Response includes: AFCA contact, cooling-off period info, consumer rights

**Success Criteria - Full Integration**:
✓ Insurer correctly auto-detected in Day 1
✓ Insurance requirements enforced in contractor selection (Day 4)
✓ Code of Practice timeline referenced consistently (Days 10, 35)
✓ AFCA information provided when needed (Day 35)

## PERFORMANCE METRICS

**Expected Performance Improvements with Snake Build Pattern**:
- System prompt reduction: ~70% (from 200+ tokens to ~80 tokens)
- Context window savings: ~20-25% per execution (via skill progressive disclosure)
- Response time: <2 seconds for validation, <3 seconds for scoring
- Cost per execution: ~30% reduction due to smaller prompts

**Baseline Metrics to Establish**:
- Average response time per workflow node
- Token usage per execution
- Accuracy of auto-detected insurers
- Contractor matching consistency
- Customer support escalation accuracy
