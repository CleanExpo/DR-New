## 📸 Your Water Damage Image

The system analyzed your image (`picture-241056176.jpg`) and can generate descriptions like:

> "Professional water damage mitigation deployment utilizing IICRC S500-compliant restoration equipment including DryAir inflatable air chamber drying mat system and industrial-grade dehumidification unit. Affected timber flooring substrate exhibits visible moisture infiltration requiring controlled environmental drying conditions established through polyethylene containment barrier installation per AS/NZS 3760 safety protocols..."

**E.E.A.T. Elements:**
- ✅ IICRC S500 standards referenced
- ✅ Australian building codes (AS/NZS 3760)
- ✅ Technical terminology (moisture infiltration, microbial colonisation)
- ✅ Australian English spelling
