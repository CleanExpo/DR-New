 * This script regenerates ONLY the mould-containment-setup.jpg image
 * with an IICRC S520 compliant prompt that emphasizes:
 * - Realistic equipment connections (no kinked ducting)
 * - Properly attached hoses between machines
 * - Professional mould remediation setup
 *
 * Issue: Original image showed kinked ducting not properly attached
 * between machines - unrealistic equipment connections.

  prompt: `Professional photograph of mould remediation containment setup in Australian residential property.

SCENE: Professional mould containment with HEPA air scrubbers and negative air setup in an Australian home.

CRITICAL EQUIPMENT REALISM REQUIREMENTS (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- All flexible ducting must be STRAIGHT and properly tensioned - ABSOLUTELY NO KINKS or bends
- Every duct must be SECURELY ATTACHED to equipment intake/exhaust ports with visible clamps or tape
- Negative air machine exhaust duct must run DIRECTLY to window with proper seal
- HEPA air scrubber connections must show professional sealed fittings
- Ducting must follow realistic physics - properly supported, not floating in mid-air
- All hose connections must show where they attach to machines - no disconnected ends
- Ducting must have natural tension and slight curves (not tight angles)

CONTAINMENT SETUP (IICRC S520 STANDARD):
- 6 mil polyethylene sheeting barriers from floor to ceiling
- Zipper door access points with proper sealing tape around edges
- Clear poly sheeting with visible seams taped professionally
- CAUTION or DANGER signage clearly visible (mould remediation warning)
- Evidence of negative pressure (slight inward bow of plastic sheeting)

EQUIPMENT ARRAY (PROFESSIONAL GRADE):
- HEPA air scrubber (minimum 500 CFM capacity) with ducting ATTACHED
- Negative air machine with exhaust running to window/exterior
- Air movers for circulation within containment
- All equipment positioned professionally with clear purpose

LIGHTING AND SETTING:
- Australian residential interior (weatherboard or brick home)
- Natural window light supplemented by professional work lights
- Clean, organised professional setup appearance
- Blue or clear protective floor covering visible

CAMERA SPECIFICATIONS:
- Wide-angle 24mm lens, f/8 aperture for depth of field
- Showing complete containment system in frame
- Slightly elevated angle to show equipment layout
- Sharp focus throughout the scene

STYLE: IICRC S520-compliant professional mould remediation documentation photography

PHOTOREALISM CHECKLIST (MUST PASS):
- [ ] All equipment connections are physically realistic and complete
- [ ] Ducting shows proper attachment points with visible clamps/tape
- [ ] Hoses follow gravity and natural tension - no floating sections
- [ ] No impossible bends, kinks, or kinked sections in any ducting
- [ ] Lighting is consistent throughout the image
- [ ] Shadows are realistic and properly placed
- [ ] Equipment proportions match real-world specifications
- [ ] Australian context maintained (architecture, fittings)

STRICTLY AVOID:
- Kinked, bent, or twisted ducting (CRITICAL - this was the original issue)
- Disconnected or floating hoses not attached to equipment
- Unrealistic equipment connections
- Visible mould growth (health hazard in photos)
- People's faces clearly visible
- Brand logos or identifiable trademarks
- Unsafe practices or messy setup
- Horror aesthetic or exaggerated damage
- Generic stock photo appearance`,
